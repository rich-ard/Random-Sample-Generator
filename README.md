# Random Sample Generator

Have ten thousand IDs and need a random sample of forty?

This script takes a single-column .csv as input, and outputs a dataframe and/or .csv with your required sample size. The script will need to be run as Source in RStudio.

Sampling is performed using the base sample() function in R; the sampling methodology is described (with references) here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/sample.html
